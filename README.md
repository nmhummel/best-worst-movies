**Description:**
Making fun of bad movies is one of my favorite things to do. As an avid fan of MST3K and RiffTrax, I have a bad, riffed movie playing 75% of my day. 
This database is dedicated to those horrible movies that make us question our sanity, our sense of humor, and just how someone earned the money to make
such a horrific, monstrosity of a film.

**How to Get In on the Fun:**
* This project was made with Ruby version: ruby 2.6.1p33 (2019-01-30 revision 66950) [x86_64-linux]
* Fork a copy and download the files from https://github.com/nmhummel/best-worst-movies 
* Make sure you bundle install after cloning it.
* Run $rails db:seed AND $rails db:migrate to fill the database.
* System dependencies include a console of some sort: Windows Power Shell, Command Prompt, Ubuntu, etc.
* Start your rails server with $rails s and launch your localhost:3000 or whatever http:// is provided.

**Copyright:**
I own nothing of the included movies in the database. This is purely for recreational purposes.

**STATUS:** Near complete, barring tweaks to style.

**CONTRIBUTORS:**
This is my third project for Flatiron School. I don't expect this to grow into an internet sensation. If you want to add to it, just email me at natalie.hummel@gmail.com and let me know.
