**Description:**
MadLibs is a fun activity for all ages. It features two elements-- a pre-written story with blanks to fill in, and the list of words that need to go in the blanks (nouns, animals, verbs, etc.). The "writer" has control of the list of words and gets suggestions from others, then turning to another page with the corresponding story for those words. Because the story is unknown in the beginning, you may get a funny phrase, like, "To thine own hamburger be true." With this application you will be able to provide a lit of words and phrases using themed Mad Lib templates. There's also an option included for if you'd like us to enter something for you. 

**Current Story Offerings:**
A Better Star Wars Holiday Special - So you thought the Holiday Special was lame, eh? How about we write a better one?

**TO GET STARTED:**
In your terminal, fork and clone the GitHub files in the directory of your choosing.
Once you are in the project's main directory, enter 'bundle install' to get the tools you'll need to run this application properly. Once that is complete, enter 'shotgun' into the 
terminal, click the http link provided, and a new internet browser window should open.

Without them, the system-generated blanks would not have been possible.
